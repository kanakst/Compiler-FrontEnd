# Compiler-FrontEnd
Front End (Scanner, Parser) of a Simple Compiler with predefined grammar.

1) Compile the code by executing runnable file "runner.txt"
   e.g : in your terminal execute this command: ./runner.txt 

2) Prepare your testcases which you want to examine. If you don't have any, just use the one I prepared here:
   the file named "input_test.txt"

3) Run the program by executing one of the following commands in your terminal:
   
   java Main ast < input_test.txt (for printing AST)
   
   java Main code < input_test.txt (for printing pseudo-machine code)
